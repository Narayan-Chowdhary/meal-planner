Data Fetching and Filtering: The Meal Planner fetches data from an API and provides a user-friendly interface to browse and search for meals based on specific keywords. Users can easily filter the displayed data to find meals that match their preferences.
Login and Signup with Formik: The project incorporates Formik, a popular form library for React, to handle the login and signup processes. Users can securely create accounts and log in using their credentials, providing a personalized experience.
CRUD Operations: The Meal Planner implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality to manage recipes. Users can add new recipes, view existing recipes, update recipe details, and delete recipes they no longer need.
User Roles: The application distinguishes between three types of users: admin, user, and guest. Each role has different levels of access and permissions within the app. Admin users have the ability to manage user data, including adding, deleting, and updating user information.
Translation: To cater to a diverse user base, the Meal Planner includes a translation feature that allows users to switch between English and Hindi. This enables users to interact with the app in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and usability.
Recipe Management: The project includes dedicated pages for adding and editing recipes. Users can easily create new recipes by filling out relevant details, such as ingredients, instructions, and cooking times. Additionally, users have the ability to modify existing recipes as needed.
React Big Calendar Integration: The Meal Planner integrates the React Big Calendar component to provide an intuitive and visually appealing calendar view. This feature allows users to organize their meals and plan their schedules efficiently. The calendar supports adding, editing, and deleting events.
User Data Management by Admin: Admin users have exclusive access to manage user data within the application. They can add new users, delete existing user accounts, and update user information as necessary. This feature empowers administrators to maintain the system and ensure data accuracy.
Overall, the Meal Planner project combines various functionalities, including data fetching, filtering, user authentication, CRUD operations, user roles, translation, recipe management, and calendar integration. These features work together to create a robust and user-friendly application for organizing and planning meals efficiently.
